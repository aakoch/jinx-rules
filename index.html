          <p class="lead">Jinx is a game that starts when 2 people say the same word or phrase at the same time. When that happens, the first player to say "Jinx!" is the winner and the other player must buy the winner a can of Coke (or some other easily-available flavor).</p>

          <h2 class="display-10">Rules</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Upon speaking the same word or phrase, the two contestants yell "Jinx!". The first person to yell "Jinx!" is the winner.</li>
            <li>A full word or words must be spoken. Yawns, burps or other gutteral responses do not count.</li>
            <li>In case of a tie, the participants move on to "double jinx", "triple jinx" and beyond until there is a winner.</li> 
            <li>The loser may not speak until they have purchased a Coke and given it to the other player. While the standard unit is a can of soda, other sizes may be used instead.</li>
            <li>Unless agreed upon <em>before</em> the jinx (which is highly unlikely), there is no "pausing" of the game.</li>
